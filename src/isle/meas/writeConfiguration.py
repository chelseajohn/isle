    Write gauge configurations and checkpoints to a HDF5 file.

    Configurations are stored every time this measurement gets called.
    Each configuration contains
    - <B>config</B>: The gauge field as a spacetime vector represented as
       an array of complex numbers in time-major layout.
    - <B>action</B>: The action as a complex number.
    - <B>acceptance</B>: A boolean indicating whether the trajectory was accepted or not.
                         If `False`, `config` holds the previous configuration, not the
                         rejected one.

    Checkpoints can be customized separately. A checkpoint comprises of
    - <B>rng_state</B>: The state of the random number generator after the
                        accept-reject step.
    - <B>cfg</B>: A link to the corresponding configuration.

    \attention Must be called with all inline measurement parameters,
    i.e. `itr`, `act`, `acc`, and `rng`.

        Configurations are stored under a path determined from `cfgGroupnameFmt`.
        This format specifier is processed for each configuration by replacing
        the strings `'{imeas}'` and `'{itr}'`.
        - `{imeas}` starts at 0 and increases each time this measurement gets called.
        - `{itr}` is the number of the trajectory that this measurement is called on.

        The same holds for checkpoint which and `checkpointGroupnameFmt`.
        Checkpoints have their own counter `imeas`.
