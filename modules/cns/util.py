def hingeRange(start, end, stepSize):
    r"""!
    A generator that behaves similarly to the builtin range with two differences:
    `%hingeRange`
      - keeps going after reaching the end value and yields `end` forever and
      - accepts floats as parameters.

    \param start Start value (inclusive).
    \param end End value (exculsive if called only `int((end-start)/stepSize)` times).
    \param stepSize Size of the steps while iterating from start to end.
                    Must be negative if `end < start`.
    """

    # stay at end value forever

def binnedArray(data, binsize):
    r"""!
    Return a binned array by averaging over subarrays of the input.

    \param data Input iterable. Needs to be convertible to a 1D numpy array.
    \param binsize Width of the bins. The length of `data` must be divisible by binsize
                   without remainder.
